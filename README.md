### Description 
In this project, I will build and deploy a 3D web developer portfolio in React JS and Three.js that showcases my skills and projects in an interactive and immersive way. I will use the following technologies and libraries:

-ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
-React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
-TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
-Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring my React website to life with animations
-Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
-Make my code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
-Implement sending emails through a form on the website
-Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve your site’s performance using Suspense and Preload.

#### User Story

As a web developer, I want to create a portfolio website that showcases my work, skills, and contact information in a modern and mobile responsive way.


#### Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer WHEN I load the portfolio THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

WHEN I view the header THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

WHEN I view the navigation titles THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

WHEN I click on a navigation title THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

WHEN I load the portfolio the first time THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default

WHEN I am presented with the About Me section THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN I enter text into the email address field THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

WHEN I am presented with the Resume section THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

WHEN I view the footer THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
